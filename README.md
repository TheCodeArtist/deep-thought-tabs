Here are a few of the "deep thoughts" you might see:
* The face of a child can say it all, especially the mouth part of the face.
* It's sad that a family can be torn apart by something as simple as a pack of wild dogs.
* To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other.
* In weightlifting, I don't think sudden, uncontrolled urination should automatically disqualify you.
* I wish I had a kryptonite cross, because then you could keep both Dracula AND Superman away.
